## My process

I approached the project by starting a Vite-React application and installing TailwindCSS as well as filling out the proper configurations needed for the project (extended theme colors, viewport-sizes and classes). The next step was to create the overall layout of the project from a mobile-first mindset and expanded to desktop sizes for responsiveness. Afterwards I focused on creating the effect animation keyframes and creating a custom hook to handle the time-trigger functions and countdown functions. Finally adjusting the final sizes of the components for the viewports and hoverstates of the socialmedia links.

### Built with
